{-
This is the only other module aside from 'Config.Dyre' which needs
to be imported specially. It contains functions for restarting the
program (which, usefully, will cause a recompile if the config has
been changed), as well as saving and restoring state across said
restarts.

The impossibly simple function arguments are a consequence of a
little cheating we do using the 'System.IO.Storage' library. Of
course, we can't use the stored data unless something else put
it there, so this module will probably explode horribly if used
outside of a program whose recompilation is managed by Dyre.

The functions for saving and loading state come in two variants:
one which uses the 'Read' and 'Show' typeclasses, and one which
uses Data.Binary to serialize it. The 'Read' and 'Show' versions
are much easier to use thanks to automatic deriving, but the
binary versions offer more control over saving and loading, as
well as probably being a bit faster.
